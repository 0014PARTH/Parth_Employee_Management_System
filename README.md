# 👨‍💼 Employee Management System

I have developed an **Employee Management System** using backend technologies such as **Java** and **Spring Boot**, along with **MySQL** as the database. For the front end, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Thymeleaf** for dynamic content rendering.

This project follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture and supports complete **CRUD operations**—allowing users to create, read, update, and delete employee records. Additionally, I have implemented a **search functionality** that enables users to easily find employees by name through a search bar.
