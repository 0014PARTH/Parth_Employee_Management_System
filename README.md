###👨‍💼 Employee Management System

I have developed an Employee Management System using backend technologies such as Java and Spring Boot, along with MySQL as the database. For the front end, I used HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf for dynamic content rendering.
This project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and supports complete CRUD operations—allowing users to create, read, update, and delete employee records. Additionally, I have implemented a search functionality that enables users to easily find employees by name through a search bar.
